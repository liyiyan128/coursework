# Example Coursework
This repository contains my example coursework of the following courses:


## [Algorithms - Princeton University](https://github.com/liyiyan128/example-projects-cw/tree/main/algs4) (Coursera/Online)
This classic algorithms course offered by Princeton University explores algorithms and data structures,
with emphasis on applications and scientific analysis of Java implementations.
- All coursework completed using Java.

**Keywords:** Algorithms, Data Structure, Java.


## [Network Science - Imperial College London](https://github.com/liyiyan128/example-projects-cw/tree/main/NetworkScience)
The example project analysed a complex brain neural network using NetworkX.
- Analysed the degree distribution and node centrality of the network.
- Developed Python script to efficiently compute *PageRank centrality* by the power method,
  using Numpy arrays and SciPy sparse matrices to accelerate.
- Visualised important nodes and links of the brain neural network using Matplotlib.

**Keywords:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Network Science, PageRank Centrality.
